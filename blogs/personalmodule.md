# Personal Powershell Module
My personal powershell module is based on the practice laid out by the legend that is [RamblingCookieMonster]. It is cloned from a repo into `$HOME\Documents\Powershell\Modules` on each development environment I use.  Every Windows VM has it, my Macbook has it, therefor, every OS that I use has the same toolkit available to me. I remember just one set of commands for my tools and know if i ever add a tool then it is easily updated in all environments.

Scope can be a complex issue in PowerShell if not understood.
